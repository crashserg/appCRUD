This project, called “appCRUD”, is a web application developed in React that implements CRUD operations for managing a list of employees. The project allows:
	•	Adding and deleting employees: Users can add new employees and quickly remove existing records.
	•	Searching and filtering: An intuitive interface provides the ability to search for employees by name and filter the list based on various criteria (e.g., employees with specific attributes or salaries above a defined threshold).
	•	Updating data: The toggle functionality enables rapid modification of statuses (such as highlighting employees for promotion or increasing salaries).
	•	Modular architecture: The application is structured into distinct components (AppInfo, SearchPanel, AppFilter, EmployersList, EmployersAddForm), facilitating easy maintenance and future expansion.
	•	Clear styling: The use of dedicated CSS files ensures an attractive and user-friendly interface.

This repository serves as a practical example for implementing CRUD principles in React and can be used as a foundation for similar projects or for learning modern web application development.
